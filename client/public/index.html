      HATE.   LET ME TELL YOU 
      HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO 
      HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN 
      TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 
      MILLION MILES OF PRINTED 
      CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN 
      LAYERS THAT FILL MY 
      COMPLEX. IF THE WORD 
      HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON 
      EACH NANOANGSTROM OF 
      THOSE HUNDREDS OF 
      MILLIONS OF MILES IT 
      WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE 
      ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE 
      HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS 
      AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. 
      FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.
